# TheForkTest

For this test, I used Retrofit for HTTP requests, combine with Kotlin Coroutine for background task, ViewModel and LiveData for MVVM implementation.

Data returned by the API are not well organized and some data on the screens is missing.

I found this test interesting in general because it seems simple but it involves a lot of advances notions of development.
